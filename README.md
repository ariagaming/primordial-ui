## Introduction

[https://ariagaming.github.io/primordial-ui/](https://ariagaming.github.io/primordial-ui/)

Primordial UI is a UI framework build on top of React which lets you write what
you need to write. It works as a nice functional wrapper on top of a normal web
application.

While reading through this documentation and while checking some things out
yourself I hope you realize that each element in Primordial UI has been
carefully designed with a purpose in mind. Nothing is treated as an
after-thought. If you encounter things which do not work or don't work well,
please open a ticket and we'll try and get those things fixed as soon as
possible.

## This is Ugly!

Yes, I understand. Primordial's basic controls are ugly. This is all according
to plan. Primordial is not meant to provide great looking components, other
libraries can do that. I can recommend plenty of them, MaterialUI, antd and many
others provide beautiful components for building your applications. Primordial
provides a functional Wrapper which you can use to work with these components.
